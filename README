==================== 
= Password Manager = 
====================


Password manager aims to be a simple but efective password database, but not
a sharing password application, only for a reduced number of sysadmin or developers.

My work as sysadmin, require to save a lot of passwords for installed applications
from 100 to more of 1000.

FEATURES:

 * Search for metadata
 * Passwords are only visible by clicking on the password field, otherwise it is hidden from prying eyes
 * passwords are encripted on the database based on django.core.signing
 * filters on right size django bar, date, uploader and TOP LOGINS with facets for logins with at least 3 logins

TODO:
 * send emails with new window and a django template
 * change passwords textbox to password box
 * migration to django 1.6
 
REQUIREMENTS:
 * Django 1.4
 * you have a requirements.txt file to use with python pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt
